# Bridging human and animal personality: A new behavioural test to assess reward sensitivity

## Project description
Accounting for individual differences in depression or resilience is crucial to ensure individualised well-being. Differences in tendencies to approach rewards and avoid threats reflect personality, and help to understand what animals, including humans, want and like. At the neural level, these tendencies involve the behavioural activation system (BAS) and the behavioural inhibition system (BIS). Unlike in humans, BIS/BAS scales do not exist in non-human animals. We developed an innovative test to investigate reactions to rewards (BAS) and approach-avoidance conflicts (BIS), by presenting a clear positive and a clear negative stimulus simultaneously using the domestic pig as a model. After testing 101 piglets, we showed that this test is reproducible, highly repeatable and linked with classic personality dimensions assessed with four established personality tests. We demonstrate novel individual tendencies related to approach-avoidance conflicts (BIS) and reward responsiveness (BAS) which are connected to specific personality traits. These findings address the gap between human and non-human animal personality research. Our study addresses individual differences in perceived rewards, which has strong implications in promoting positive animal welfare and mental health.
